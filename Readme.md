# Introduction for the data set 
According to UNESCO, "education is the process of facilitating learning or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, 
values, beliefs and habits". Most people believe that all children are educated but there are really poor countries
where education is not given. Schooling cultivates peace, reduces poverty and grows sustainable development.
It cultivates critical thinking and unaffected thinking. Also, refines the inner world of man, sensitizes his soul
and creates a moral character. The necessity and usefulness of education based on the above is considered
self-evident. However, the effectiveness and performance of each student is influenced by various factors that
we will consider below according to the given data set.
More specifically, the Portuguese education system consists of three levels. The basic which lasts 9 years, the
second that lasts 3 years and the higher. The first two are mandatory and free. When students start the second
level they have to choose the direction of the courses they will follow for their professional career. The categories
are: a) science-humanities courses, b) vocational courses and c) other education and training provision. The
evaluation is carried out in a formative and cumulative way. Moreover, the highest grade students can achieve
is 20 and the lowest is 0. They are examined in two periods (variables G1,G2) and the last evaluation (G3)
describes the final grade.

The given data set (14-15 student.zip) comes from two Portuguese secondary schools. As the reader can understand from the above table, it contains studentâ€™s grades at the "Portuguese language" subject, demographic,
social and school related features which were collected through reports, based on paper sheets, and questionnaires with closed questions. Below will be an extensive analysis that will include:
- explanatory analysis for the dataset
- visual description for the most important findings
- pairwise associations
- regression models to asses the responses
